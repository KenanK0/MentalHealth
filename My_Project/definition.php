                    <p>According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness.
                        People with anxiety disorders normally have severe fear or anxiety, which relates to certain objects or situations. Most of these people with such disorders will try to avoid exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore important to note that everyone experiences anxiety from time to time as it is the way our bodies keep us alert. But it becomes an issue when emotions of worry or fear interfere with our day-to-day life.</p>
                    <div id = "align"><p><strong>Common types of anxiety disorders include:</strong></p></div>
                    <p><strong>•	Social phobia or social anxiety disorder: </strong>A disorder that causes people to avoid social or performance situations for fear of being embarrassed or rejected. </p>
                    <p><strong>•	Generalised anxiety disorder: </strong> An excessive, uncontrollable worry about a range of ordinary issues which are health, work or finance related. </p></p>

                <div id="p">
                <p>Depression is a common mental disorder and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study (2017), an estimated 264 million people are affected by depression globally as more women are affected than men.</p> 
                    <p>Depression is characterised by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt and poor concentration. People with depression may also have multiple complaints with no apparent physical cause. It can be long-lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing people’s ability to function and to cope with daily life. At its most severe, depression can lead to suicide. </p>
                    <p><strong>Copying strategies</strong>
                    <p>Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression, both for children protection and psychological support.</p>
                    <p>Therapies: also, an effective treatment. Mild to moderate depression can be effectively treated with talking therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy or psychotherapy.</p>
                    <p>Antidepressants can be an effective form of treatment for moderate to severe depression but are not the first line of treatment for cases of mild depression. They should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with caution.</p> 
                    <p>Therefore, management of depression should include psychosocial aspects, including identifying stress factors. These include financial problems, difficulties at work or physical or mental abuse, and sources of support, such as family members and friends. The maintenance or reactivation of social networks and social activities is important.</p>

                <strong><br><div id = "align"> Go for a walk, stretch or exercise:</div></strong>
                <li>This refocuses your attention on your body movements which helps you cope with PTSD symptoms and reduce your stress levels and - according to Ryan Collins - during physical activity endorphins are released which are a type of neurotransmitter that helps relieve pain as well as stress.</li>
                <strong></br><div id = "align">Go for art therapy:</div></strong>
                <li>Art therapy, being one of the types of PTSD therapy, prevents the internalization of your emotions and teaches you ways to cope with unsettling memories and experiences through the use of art.</li>
                <strong></br><div id = "align">Adopt a pet for PTSD:</div></strong>
                <li>Getting a pet that’s been trained to identify as well as interrupt the arising of PTSD symptoms is an effective approach to assisting you when it comes to coping with the symptoms. This approach is a short-term way of coping.</li>
                <li>According to the National Institutes of Health, spending at least a week with a dog that’s specially trained decreased PTSD symptoms by 82%.</li>
                <strong><div id = "align"> </br>Take a moment to focus on your breathing:</div></strong>
                <li>Controlling your breathing will slow down your heart rate and redirect your focus on you breathing which helps you avoid being consumed by intrusive thoughts.</li>
                <strong></br><div id = "align">Redirect your focus:</div></strong>
                <li>Listen to music, spend time focusing on an enjoyable hobby, read a book or watch something relaxing, pray or meditate to distract you from your anxiety and in turn calm yourself.</li>
