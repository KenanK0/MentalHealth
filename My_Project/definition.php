                        <p>According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness.People with anxiety disorders normally have severe fear or anxiety, which relates to certain objects or situations. Most of these people with such disorders will try to avoid exposure to whatever triggers their anxiety.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore important to note that everyone experiences anxiety from time to time as it is the way our bodies keep us alert. But it becomes an issue when emotions of worry or fear interfere with our day-to-day life.</p>

                <div class= "alignment">
                    <p>Depression is a common mental disorder and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study (2017), an estimated 264 million people are affected by depression globally as more women are affected than men.</p> 
                    <p>Depression is characterised by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt and poor concentration. People with depression may also have multiple complaints with no apparent physical cause. It can be long-lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing people’s ability to function and to cope with daily life. At its most severe, depression can lead to suicide. </p>
                    <p><strong><div class = "align">The following are the types of depression:</div></strong></p>
                    <br> A depressive episode can be categorised as mild, moderate or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms. Moreover, there is a key distinction between depression in people who have or don't have a history of manic epsiodes but both types can be chronic. 
                    <p> <strong> Recurrent depressive disorder:</strong> this type of disorder involves repeated depressive episodes whereby one can experience depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to diminished activity for at least two weeks.<p>
                    <p><strong> Bipolar affective disorder:</strong> this type of depression typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated or irritable mood, over-activity, pressure of speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased need for sleep</p>
                    <p><strong><div class = "align">Copying strategies</div></strong>
                    <p>Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression, both for children protection and psychological support.</p>
                    <p>Therapies: also, an effective treatment. Mild to moderate depression can be effectively treated with talking therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy or psychotherapy.</p>
                    <p>Antidepressants can be an effective form of treatment for moderate to severe depression but are not the first line of treatment for cases of mild depression. They should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with caution.</p> 
                    <p>Therefore, management of depression should include psychosocial aspects, including identifying stress factors. These include financial problems, difficulties at work or physical or mental abuse, and sources of support, such as family members and friends. The maintenance or reactivation of social networks and social activities is important.</p>

                <div class = "alignment">
                    <p>This type of mental disorder affects about 45 million worldwide according to the Global Burden of Disease Study (2017). It typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated or irritable mood, over-activity, rapid speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased need for sleep. People who have manic attacks but do not experience depressive episodes are also classified as having bipolar disorder.</p> 
                    <p> Biploar disorder is a category that includes three different diagnoses which are:<strong> bipolar 1, biploar 11 and cyclothymic disorder</strong>.</p> 
                    <br><strong> Bipolar 1 Disorder: </strong> is a type of disorder diagnosed when a person experiences a manic episode.During a manic episode, people with bipolar I disorder experience an extreme increase in energy and may feel on top of the world or uncomfortably irritable in mood. Some people with bipolar I disorder also experience depressive or hypomanic episodes, and most people with bipolar I disorder also have periods of neutral mood. </p>
                    <br> <strong> Bipolar 11 Disorder: </strong> requires someone to have at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. People return to their usual functioning between episodes. People with bipolar II disorder often first seek treatment as a result of their first depressive episode, since hypomanic episodes often feel pleasurable and can even increase performance at work or school.
                    <p> People with bipolar II disorder frequently have other mental illnesses such as an anxiety disorder or substance use disorder, the latter of which can exacerbate symptoms of depression or hypomania. </p> 
                    <br> <strong> Cyclothymic disorder: </strong> is a disorder which is a milder form of bipolar involving many "mood swings", with hypomania and depressive symptoms that occur frequently. People with cyclothymia experience emotional ups and downs but with less severe symptoms than bipolar1 or 11 disorder.

                <li>This refocuses your attention on your body movements which helps you cope with PTSD symptoms and reduce your stress levels and - according to Ryan Collins - during physical activity endorphins are released which are a type of neurotransmitter that helps relieve pain as well as stress.</li>

                <li>According to the National Institutes of Health, spending at least a week with a dog that’s specially trained decreased PTSD symptoms by 82%.</li>
